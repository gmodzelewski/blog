On July 23, 2024, we had the pleasure of hosting a Quarkus workshop for one of our customers. The workshop provided an in-depth exploration of Quarkus, with a particular focus on the [Quarkus Superheroes demo](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-super-heroes). The event was designed to cater to a wide range of experience levels among the participants, from those who were new to Quarkus to those already running production applications. Our goal was to cover both foundational topics and deeper, more complex aspects of Quarkus to ensure the content was engaging and valuable for everyone.

## Workshop Overview

### Agenda Highlights

The workshop was carefully structured to balance basic concepts with advanced techniques, making it accessible yet challenging for all participants:

1. **Quarkus Overview**: We began with an introduction to Quarkus, discussing its optimization for cloud-native applications, microservices, and serverless environments. This session was designed to set the stage for both newcomers and experienced developers by highlighting how Quarkus modernizes Java for a containerized world.

2. **Quarkus Superheroes Demo**: As the core of the workshop, we explored the Quarkus Superheroes demo in detail. This demo is a comprehensive example that demonstrates Quarkus's capabilities across a variety of scenarios. It served as a practical guide for understanding how to implement best practices in Quarkus, regardless of the participant's prior experience.

3. **Discussion on the Customer's Use of Quarkus**: We facilitated a discussion on how the customer is currently leveraging Quarkus, exploring both successes and challenges. This session was invaluable for understanding real-world applications and uncovering specific needs that Quarkus can address.

4. **Interactive Sessions and Q&A**: To ensure everyone could engage with the material at their own level, we included hands-on sessions and a Q&A segment. Participants were encouraged to ask questions and explore solutions tailored to their specific contexts.

### Key Takeaways

The Quarkus Superheroes demo is a robust tool for learning and implementing Quarkus. It offers practical, real-world examples that range from basic to advanced, ensuring that all participants could find relevant and applicable content. Some of the key areas covered include:

- **Reactive Programming**: Participants learned how to build responsive, non-blocking services with Quarkus's reactive programming model, ideal for those looking to scale applications efficiently in cloud environments.
  
- **Microservice Communication**: We delved into the complexities of inter-service communication, demonstrating the use of SmallRye Stork for service discovery and client-side load balancing. This was particularly valuable for participants with production experience.

- **Persistence Strategies**: The demo provided insights into various persistence strategies, from traditional ORM with Panache to more modern reactive data handling, offering something for both beginners and seasoned developers.

- **CI/CD and Testing**: We highlighted the importance of CI/CD pipelines and testing best practices, using examples from the demo to show how to automate and ensure the quality of Quarkus-based applications.
