# Camel K Proof of Concept Series

I am currently taking part in a proof of concept for Camel K (the kubernetes deployment solution of the Quarkus-based integration solution Camel) and have had some experiences that I would like to share in four blog posts describing partial solutions.

The basic version of the source code was created by my dear colleague Jean Nyilimbibi and [published it open source here: https://bitbucket.org/jnyilimbibi/camel-k-usecases](https://bitbucket.org/jnyilimbibi/camel-k-usecases)

I forked his git repository and restructured it so that all non-Camel-K solution software is managed in a helm chart. 

This separates the environment creation (with all of the needed instances such as a database or a minio instance)
to make it clear how easy it is to create complex solutions in Camel K: https://bitbucket.org/gpmodz/camel-k-usecases

In general, the solutions were created using Kaoto (https://kaoto.io/), a no-code solution that allows you to simply click your integrations via a graphical user interface.
